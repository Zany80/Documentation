		<h1>Zany80</h1>
		<h2>Todo list</h2>
		<p>These are in no particular order, and will as such not be completed in order. If you feel a feature should take precedence,
		<a href="mailto:pleasantatk@gmail.com">tell me.</a> I don't even need a reason given, though if someone gives a good reason to
		complete x and someone else says "Plz do y" x will most likely come first. Of course, this is assuming anyone cares enough...</p>
		<p>On that depressing note, here's the list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Completely overhaul plugin system</li>
			<li>Find out if sass works on Mac</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If so, yay! Build a copy for Mac.</li>
				<li>If not, find an assembler that does or package Windows version with WINE or fix it so it does</li>
			</ul>
			<li>See if I can build for mac w/o a mac</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If not, package the Windows binary with a version of WINE for Mac</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Rewrite MMU</li>
			<li>Documentation - Design Document especially</li>
			<li>Plan out emulated GPU</li>
		</ul>
